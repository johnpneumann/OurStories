# Our Stories
My daughter Grace loves to write stories and she loves to draw.
I asked her if she wanted to put them up for everyone to read and
she said yes. Because I'm a nerd, I figured git was a good place.

She drives every decision about this. She chose the License as
it was explained to her, she chose to have this be public, she
chose the name and everything else. I'm simply helping her put
it up and translate it - she's just learning to write words so
the markdown file associated with the story is there to help
with that.

better and longer, but she didn't want anyone selling them. She
wants it to be free.
